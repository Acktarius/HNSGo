# HNS Go

## What We Want to Achieve

HNS Go is an Android application that enables local resolution of Handshake domain names. The app syncs with the Handshake blockchain using SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) and runs local DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) servers, allowing you to resolve Handshake domains (e.g., website.conceal where .conceal is the TLD) directly on your Android device.
